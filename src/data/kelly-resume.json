    "summary": "After spending years working in real estate and law firm offices, I felt that my skills were under-utilized and my work days left me feeling unfulfilled. Exploring other outlets, I soon found that coding gave me the sense of self-satisfaction I was looking for. Over the past year and a half, I devoted my full time to studying programming languages and software development. I have applied the knowledge I've acquired through online courses to create a variety of projects that showcase my skills as a self-taught developer, and hope to utilize these skills at a full-time position for a company looking for someone with self-motivation and drive!",
